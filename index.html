<p>
I am a Research Scientist and Engineer with over 8 years of post-PhD experience.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy working on challenging problems and new application areas, where I strive
to solve problems using <b>Computer Science</b>, <b>High-performance Computing</b>,
<b>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</b>, and <b>Data Analytics and Visualization</b>.
</p>

<p>
I earned my Ph.D. in Computing from
<a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu" target=_blank>Scientific Computing & Imaging Institute, University of Utah</a>,
and spent several years of R&D at
<a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/casc" target=_blank>Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>,
where I worked on diverse problems, such as computational biology, battery simulations,
plasma physics, and others. At LLNL, my broad focus was to facilitate large-scale
simulations and understand and explore simulation data.

<p>
At
<a href="https://neonlife.ai/" target=_blank>Samsung Research America</a>,
I spent time gaining experience in multimodal Generative AI and
developing, automating, and improving data-to-ML pipelines.
