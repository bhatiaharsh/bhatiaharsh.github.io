<p>
I am a Research Scientist and Engineer with over 8 years of post-PhD experience.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy working on challenging problems and new application areas, where I strive
to solve problems using Computer Science, High-performance Computing, Machine
Learning and Deep Learning, and Data Analytics and Visualization.
</p>

<p>
I earned my Ph.D. in Computing from <b>SCI Institute, University of Utah</b>, and spent
several years of R&D at <b>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</b>, where I worked on
diverse problems, such as computational biology, battery simulations, plasma physics,
and others. At LLNL, my broad focus was to facilitate large-scale simulations and
understand and explore simulation data.

<p>
At <b>Samsung Research America</b>, I spent time gaining experience in multimodal
Generative AI and developing, automating, and improving data-to-ML pipelines.
